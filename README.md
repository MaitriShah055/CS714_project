## Lane Detection in Autonomous Driving
## Autonomous driving represents a significant technological advancement, promising to revolutionize the transportation industry. By leveraging advancements in sensors, machine learning algorithms, and real-time data processing, autonomous vehicles (AVs) can navigate and operate with minimal human intervention. Lane detection is a fundamental component of AV technology, enabling vehicles to stay within their designated lanes and maintain safe navigation. The autonomous vehicles are made of a lot of sensors and different systems.
