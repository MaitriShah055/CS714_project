## Lane Detection in Autonomous Driving
### Autonomous driving represents a significant technological advancement, promising to revolutionize the transportation industry. By leveraging advancements in sensors, machine learning algorithms, and real-time data processing, autonomous vehicles (AVs) can navigate and operate with minimal human intervention. Lane detection is a fundamental component of AV technology, enabling vehicles to stay within their designated lanes and maintain safe navigation. The autonomous vehicles are made of a lot of sensors and different systems.
### Autonomous driving technology has rapidly evolved over the past decade, promising safer roads and more efficient transportation. A core component of any autonomous driving system is its ability to perceive the environment accurately, with lane detection being a critical task. Lane markings serve as guiding paths for vehicles, enabling them to stay within designated lanes, make safe turns, and avoid collisions.
## Problem Statement
### The main challenge in lane detection lies in accurately identifying lane boundaries under diverse and unpredictable driving conditions. This project aims to address these challenges by developing a lane detection system based on FCNs, which can generalize well across different environments and adapt to the varying appearances of lane markings. As current lane detection systems often struggle with inconsistencies across different lighting, weather, and traffic conditions
